# Fertilisation

There are 2 reactions that occur during fertilisation. These are
the acrosome and cortical reactions.

## Acrosome Reaction:

 - Sperm contacts the zona pellucida.

 - The acrosome swells.

 - The acrosome fuses with the sperm cell surface membrane.

 - The enzymes (acrosin) are released from the acrosome, which
	digest the zona pellucida.

 - The sperm head fuses with the ovum cell membrane, the tail gets
	left behind.


## Cortical Reaction:

 - The sperm contacts the ovum surface membrane.

 - Cortical granules (vesicles) in the ovum move to the edge of
	the membrane.

 - These granules fuse with the ovum cell surface membrane.

 - They release their enzymes which cause the zona pellucida to
	thicken.

 - This prevents more than one sperm from entering the egg, that would
	be called polyspermy.
