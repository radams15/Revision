# Meiosis

This results in haploid cells.

Daughter cells are gametes.

1 cell forms 4 daughter nuclei that are
genetically different.

## Mechanism

 - Division of the nucleus

 - 2 cycles of PMAT

 - Crossovers / chiasmata:

 	- Occurs in prophase I.

	- Chromatids of homologous pairs cross over each
		other, break parts off and rejoin, recombining
		random alleles.

	- So some chromatids contain maternal and paternal alleles.

 - Independent assortment:
	- Occurs in metaphase 1

	- Homologous chromosomes line up on the equator randomly.

	- So each gamete has different combinations of maternal
		and paternal chromosomes.

## Role of mitosis:

 - Increases cell numbers

 - Enables growth of an embryo/organism.

 - Repairs damaged tissues.

 - Replaces dead cells.

 - Enables asexual reproduction.

 - Can cause tumours.

## Role of meiosis:

 - Genetic variation increased.

 - Gamete production in sexual reproduction.
