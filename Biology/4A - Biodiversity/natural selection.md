# Natural Selection

This is:

- Mutation
- Variation
- Survival of the fittest
- Breeding
- Pass on alleles

Natural selection is where successful phenotypes are passed on to later
generations, as the organisms with these phenotypes survive to breed.

A gene pool is all the genes in a population, usually from a particular species.

More variation means a larger gene pool, so a lower chance of extinction.


Isolation can be 3 things:

- Geographical: rivers, mountains, etc.
- Ecological: habitats/environment change due to pH, salinity
- Reproductive: courtship behaviours, physical failure of gametes to fuse..

## Variation

Ecological niche - the place of each species in an ecosystem. This is not just a
physical place, but the role it plays also.

Well adapted animals are more likely to survive to pass on genes. These adaptations
include 3 categories:

- Anatomical (about the body): blubber layer, camouflage, long necks, hollow bones in birds.
- Physiological (inside the body): dive reflex, changing between aerobic/anaerobic respiration.
- Behavioural (response to environment): migration, moving to sun for warmth, playing dead.
