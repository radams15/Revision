# Endemic Species

These are species that are found wild only in one geographic location.

They are often found on isolated islands.

Endemism is beneficial because the species are well adapted, until there is an environmental
change such as:

- Fast change in climate.
- New diseases.
- Habitat loss.
- New predators.

Many endemic species are endangered because humans cause these environmental
changes.
