# Biodiversity

This is the variety of species, but also the genetic variation inside
a species.


Species richness - the number of species in a given area.

Species evenness - how close the number of species in an environment is, e.g. 5 foxes
and 1000 dogs is not even, but 10 foxes and 11 dogs is even.


We conserve species because:

- They provide food/medicine for us.
- Plants prevent flooding.
- Plants release oxygen for us.
- They clean up water that we drink by killing toxic algae.


Larger heterozygosities are better for species to survive as there is more
genetic variation to survive in more scenarios.

Inbreeding leads to an increase in homozygous recessive alleles, which can be bad for
species survival.

## Equations

$\text{Heterozygosity index, H} = \dfrac{\text{number of heterozygotes}}
{\text{number of individuals in the population}}$

<br>
<br>
<br>

$D = \dfrac{N (N-1)} {\Sigma n (n-1)}$

Where:

- N = the total number of all species.
- n = the number of organisms of a specific species.

This is useful for comparing biodiversity between areas.

## Hardy Weinberg equation

This equation shows if evolution is occurring.

If f $p^2$ and $q^2$ stay the same, there is no evolution, but if the numbers
drastically differ, there is evolution occurring.

The Hardy Weinberg principle only applies if the
frequency of alleles stays the same. This means:

- No mutations.
- No migration.
- No selection.
- Random mating.
- Large population size.

$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$

$p + q = 1$

$p^2$ : homozygous dominant

$2pq$ : heterozygotes

$q^2$ : homozygous recessive

### Example:

98 of 200 penguins are homozygous recessive for blue eyes.

$q^2 = \dfrac{98}{200} = 0.49$

$q = \sqrt{0.49} = 0.7$

$p + q = 1 \therefore p = 0.3$

$2pq = 2 \times 0.3 \times 0.7 = 0.42$

so:

- $q^2$ = 0.49
- $q$ is 0.7
- $p$ is 0.3
- $2pq$ is 0.42
