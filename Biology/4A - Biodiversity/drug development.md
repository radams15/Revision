# Drug Development

A drug is a substance that alters chemical reactions in the body.

Double blind trials are unbiased as they do not let the doctor or the patient
know if the drug they are getting is a placebo or not.

A placebo looks like a drug but has no active ingredient, or could be a drug that
is already on the market to see if the new drug is better.

There are 4 ethical frameworks:

- Utilitarianism: the best for all people
- Rights and duties
- Autonomy: for yourself
- Virtues: morals
