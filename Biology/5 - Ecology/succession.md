# Succession

Change in community of an area over time.

## Primary Succession

Organisms colonise barren area.

E.g. bare rock.

## Secondary Succession

Organisms re-colonise an area that was destroyed.

E.g. after a wildfire.

## Stages - On Bare Rock

- Pioneers such as lichens which erode rock. These die and decompose.

- Plants such as grasses grow on the soil left by decomposing pioneers. They allow consumers to survive on their shoots.

- Shrubs grow on decomposed grasses. These support different consumers and increase the moisture level of the soil.

- Climax community - Trees grow and outcompete other plants.
