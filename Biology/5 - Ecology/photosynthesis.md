# Photosynthesis

Light energy converted to chemical energy store (glucose).

## Light-Dependent Reaction.


### Photoexcitation

Light energy excites 2 electrons from chlorophyll.

Electrons leave chlorophyll.

Electron carrier molecules receive the electrons.

The energy from this movement is used to synthesise ATP from ADP+Pi (inorganic phosphate).


## Photophosphorylation

H^+ ions are pumped into thylakoid disc.

H^+ diffuses into stroma through ATP synthase which joins ADP+Pi to form ATP using the energy from the moving H+ ions.
