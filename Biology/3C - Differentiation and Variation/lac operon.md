# The Lac Operon

An operon is a group of genes with a single promoter.

A promoter is a section of DNA that is required for transcription
to occur.

An inducer molecule is a molecule that can enable or disable a gene. For the lac operon,
the inducer molecule is lactose.


The enzyme that is needed to break down lactose is $\beta$-galactosidase.


Enabling lactase production:

- Lactose diffuses into the cell.

- Lactose binds to the repressor molecule.

- This deforms the repressor molecule, meaning the molecule can
	no longer bind to the promoter, so the repressor releases.

- When the DNA is replicated, the DNA polymerase can transcript the gene,
	meaning that $\beta$-galactosidase and permease is produced by the cell.

- The permease is a channel protein that increases the rate of diffusion into the cell,
	increasing the amount of lactose that can be converted into glucose.


Disabling lactase production:

- There is no longer any lactose, as it has all been broken down by the lactase.

- The lactose is no longer bound to the repressor molecule, so the shape of the repressor
	reverts to normal.

- This means that the repressor binds to the promoter.

- This means that the genes for lactose digestion are no longer able to be transcribed as DNA
	polymerase can no longer bind to the promoter.
