# Protein Transport

This process is where proteins are transported from where
they are formed to their destination.

1. First, the DNA is transcribed to the mRNA in transcription.
2. Next, the mRNA leaves the nucleus.
3. The mRNA travels to the rough E.R. where the proteins are made on the
	ribosomes.
4. As proteins move through the rough E.R. they are folded.
5. Proteins enter vesicles and are transported from the rough E.R.
	to the golgi apparatus.
6. These vesicles fuse to the golgi apparatus.
7. Proteins are then modified to determine their destination, by adding sugars.
8. These modified proteins enter vesicles, and are transported around the cell.
9. Some vesicles can fuse with the cell surface membrane, secreting the proteins.
	E.g. extracellular enzymes (enzymes become lysosomes). This is an
	example of exocytotis.
