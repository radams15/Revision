# T-Tests

Done with 2 groups, with qualitative data. Done on a bar chart.

Used to compare two sets of data to see it there is any statistically significant differences or whether the data only varies because of human error.

## Degrees of freedom

#### For unpaired data:

DOF = N1 + N2 - 2

#### For unpaired data:

DOF = number of data pairs - 2

## T-Tests require these criteria:

* Sample size > 30
* Using a null hypothesis
* Data gives a normal distribution

We try to invalidate a null hypothesis to prove our original hypothesis.

To know if our result is significant, we need to know:

* The confidence level (0.05 = 5% usually)
* The degrees of freedom

## Spread
