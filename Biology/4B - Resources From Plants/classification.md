## Carl Woese

Woese added the domain group upon Linnaeus's taxonomic system.

His 3 domains are: archaea, bacteria and eukaryotea.

### Archaea:

* No nucleus
* Small 70s ribosomes
* 14 unit DNA polymerase
* More similar to eukaryotes
* Have peptidoglycan in their cell walls

#### Bacteria:

* No nucleus
* Small 70s ribosomes
* 4 unit DNA polymerase
* Less similar to eukaryotes
* No peptidolgycan in their cell wall
