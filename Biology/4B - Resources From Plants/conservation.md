# Conservation


In-situ conservation - in the wild situation, where the organism is usually found.

Ex-situ conservation - conservation outside of the wild - e.g. in a zoo / botanical garden

Stud books - data book containing births, deaths and breeding relationships for
	all members of a species kept in captivity around the world.

## Zoos

Captive breeding is done to:

- Increase species numbers
- Maintain genetic diversity
- Increase numbers of births through IVF
- Maintain a population that is extinct in the wild

### Pros and cons of zoos

Pros:

 - Conserve species

 - Feed, water, shelter for animals

Cons:

 - Can cause negative psychological effects.

 - May decrease life expectancy

 - Boring and not a challenge to survive

 - Animals could become too trusting of humans, this would be bad for survival in the wild.

 - Zoos may run out of funding.

## Seed Banks

Seeds are stored in a dormant state (seeds) so:

- Less space is required
- Collecting samples is unlikely to damage the wild population
- More cost effective
- Can store a large quantity of seeds in a fairly small space

Conditions are dry and cols to stop germination of seeds, or decay due to bacteria.


Seeds only stay viable for a few years, so every year or so (depending on the species),
a plant needs to be grown from the storage, and new seeds extracted to be stored.
