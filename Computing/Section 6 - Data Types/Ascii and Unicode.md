# ASCII and Unicode

## ASCII

This was originally 7 bits.

An 8 bit version was released to add extra characters.

The 7 bit code is compatible with 8 bit code.

Each language had a separate standard for letters, which were incompatible.

## Unicode

This was created to incorporate all characters from all languages, to unify the transmission of data.

UTF-16 was created to allow 65536 characters.

UTF-32 held over a million characters so all characters could be stored.

Each character in ASCII used 2 bytes, however now in Unicode they used 4, which doubled the size
of all text files.
