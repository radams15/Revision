# Monitoring

People monitored by employers and law enforcement.

To monitor:

	- Performance.
	- Internet activity.
	- Criminals (tagging devices).
	- Car insurance (black box).
	- Social media posts by future employers.

Data can be collected by many people - these data streams are combined to create a profile about us, e.g. for insurance purposes.

Data mining - searches for patterns in large amounts of data.

Data mining used for:

	- Predict criminal activity.
	- Make business decisions (advertising/loyalty card discounts).
	- Analysis of DNA to cure diseases.
