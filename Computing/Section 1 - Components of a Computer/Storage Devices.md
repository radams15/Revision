# Storage Devices

All secondary storage devices must be able to store binary data in a non-volatile way.

## HDDs

There are multiple platters coated with magnetic particles.

These particles are polarised to either north or south to represent a 1 or 0.

The platters spin, and a read/write head polarises the particles to store data, and
records the polarisation to read data.

They have much larger capacities than SSDs, and are also cheaper.

They are slower than SSDs.

## Optical Disks

These are plastic disks that can have pits carved out of them with a high powered laser, to store either a 1 or a 0.

A low-powered laser can then read where the pits are and determine the data that is stored.

A CD-ROM can store 700MB of data, whereas a Blu-ray can store up to 50GB.

DVD-RW uses crystals that change state by using a laser, so that they can be re-written.


## SSDs

These use NAND flash to store data.

The NAND cells work by applying a current to a bit line and a word line.

This makes electrons flow from the source to a drain.

The high current through the word line also forces electrons across an insulated copper layer into a floating gate.

The electrons are trapped in the floating gate.

Data is read by reading the charge of the floating gates (electrons=0, no electrons=1).

They store data in 4KiB pages.

Data cannot be overwritten, so data must first be erased, then new data written.

They are much faster than HDDs, but have a lower capacity and are more expensive.

They also use less power, are lighter, are damage resistant, and are silent.


## Virtual Storage (Cloud Storage)

This is where data is stored on servers, and the user can edit their files from home.

Advantages are that they are cheaper than physical hard drives, are frequently backed up with high reliability, and
can be quickly scaled to increase storage.

This requires internet, and costs money in a subscription format.
