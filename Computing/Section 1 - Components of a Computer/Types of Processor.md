# Types of Processor

Before von-Neumann, programs needed to be hard-wired into the computer,
meaning reprogramming often meant re-building.

von-Neumann invented the stored program concept, which means:

- A program must be in main memory to be executed.
- The instructions are fetched from memory one at a time, then are decoded
	and executed (the FDE cycle).
