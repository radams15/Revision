# Input-Output Devices

## Input Devices

#### Barcodes

Barcodes are used to store tracking information.

They can be linear, which are often used at supermarkets, or 2d QR codes, which are
used for entry passes and text storage for URLs.

Barcodes can be read using pen-type readers, laser scanners, or camera based scanners that use image recognition.

#### Cameras

These use a CCD or a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor.

CMOS sensors are made up of millions of light sensors arranged in a grid formation to capture individual pixels of light.

CCD sensors provide a better images. They are more expensive but also are older so are more reliable and tested. They
however use up to 100x the power of a CMOS sensor.

#### RFID

These are both input and output devices as they can send and receive information.

They can be read up to 300m away and can be read without direct sight.

They are used for microchipping pets and for detecting stolen items at supermarkets.

They exist as passive or active tags. Passive tags are cheaper to make but have a smaller range.

## Output Devices

#### LCD Screens

Advantages over CRTs:

- Reach maximum brightness immediately.
- Sharper image
- Brightly lit with LED backlight.
- Can last for a very long time.
- Consume very little power.

#### OLED

Advantages over LCDs:

- Made of plastic rather than glass - very flexible.
- Far thinner.
- Need no backlight.
- Brighter
- Higher refresh rate.
- Better colour range.

#### Laser Printers

They are high speed and high quality printers.

They use CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, key (black)) colour instead of RGB colour.

Colour laser printers repeat the process 4 times, 1 for each colour.

They are limited by their print quality, as they are not as good for photo printing.

#### Inkjet Printers

These spray dots of ink onto paper to create the print.

The resolution is measured in DPI (dots per inch).

The printer unit is cheaper than laser printers, but cartridges must be replaced more often.

Better for photo printing.

#### Dot Matrix Printers

These strike letters onto the page with pins.

They can operate in extreme environments with lots of dust or moisture.

They have poor print quality, and they are slow.

#### 3D Printers

These print in 3d.

They can be used to print large parts for vehicles, or for prosthetic limbs.

They are good for making unique or discontinued parts.

#### Projectors

These show large images on a surface.

They allow lessons to be more interesting.

They allow presentations to be shown to the whole class to avoid crowding around one screen.

#### Actuators

These are motors.

They can be used for opening windows or doors, or moving wheels or ailerons.
