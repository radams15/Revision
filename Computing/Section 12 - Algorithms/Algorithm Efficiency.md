# Algorithm Efficiency

## Types of Function

Linear function:
$f(x) = ax + c$

Polynomial function:
$f(x) = ax^m + bx + c$

Exponential function:
$f(x) = ab^x$

Logarithmic function:
$f(x) = a  log_n x$

## Big-O Notation

$O(1)$ - Constant Time

- Constant time of execution.

- Example is array length

$O(n)$ - Linear Time

- The execution time is proportional to the data length.

- Example is a linear search.

$O(n^2)$ - Polynomial Time

- Execution time is proportional to the data size squared.

- Example is a nested loop.

$O(2^n)$ - Exponential Time

- Execution time doubles for every item added.
- These are the slowest algorithms.

$O(log n)$ - Logarithmic Time

- Execution time grows very slowly.
- These are the fastest algorithms.
