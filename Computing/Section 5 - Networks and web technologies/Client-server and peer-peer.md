# Client to Server and Peer to Peer

## Client to Server

This is where the client directly connects to one server to get files.

There could be multiple servers on a network.

#### Advantages:

- Better security as files are in one location.
- Central backups are done to avoid data loss.

#### Disadvantages:

- Expensive to install and manage.
- Specialised staff are required to maintain.

## Peer to Peer

Each device connects to all other devices in a mesh network.

#### Advantages:

- Cheap to setup.
- Users share resources between each other.
- Easy to maintain.

#### Disadvantage:

The main disadvantage is that they are often used for piracy through torrent sites,
which can affect the media industry.

## Processing

Web servers or the client can be used for processing data.

#### Server-side Processing

The browser sends a request to the web server.

The server then performs operations, then returns a response to the user.

This is usually done with back end languages such as PHP which will incorporate SQL for databases.

#### Client-side Processing

This is used to make the server do less processes, to ease the load on the server.

This is where the browser does processing using the client computer. This is usually done with JavaScript
code.

## APIs

These are protocols designed by programs to allow communication.

They design requests and responses for client programs to use.

## Thick/Thin Clients

#### Thin Clients

These are low powered computers, and the servers do the heavy processing.

These are easy to set up, with updates being done mainly to the server only.

They are therefore more secure, also because the data is stored on the server not the client.

They however require internet to function, as well as a very powerful server.

#### Thick Clients

These are more powerful, and require no internet.

They are however more expensive and each device needs updates done individually.

Data is fragmented between devices so has issues with integrity.
