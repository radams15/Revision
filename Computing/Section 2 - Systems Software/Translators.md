# Translators

## Assembler

This converts assembly code instructions into object code (machine code).

## Compiler

This converts high level languages into object code, all at once.

These are better than interpreters because the object code is faster to run, and can be run without an interpreter,
as well as the code not being able to be read.

## Interpreter

This converts high level languages into object code, but line by line, whilst executing the code.

These are better as they can run on any computer with an interpreter, and they save time by not compiling.

## Bytecode

This is intermediate code between source and machine code.

It can be compiled all at once as Java does, or before execution as Python does.

Bytecode is faster than source code to execute, and is also platform independent.

Java bytecode is more secure as it runs in an isolated environment.
