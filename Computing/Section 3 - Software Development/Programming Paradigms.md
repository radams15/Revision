# Programming Paradigms

## Procedural

This is where instructions are executed in order.

Have built-in data types.

Usually have data structures.

Other data structures can be defined if others do not exist.

## Object Oriented

This is where classes are used to lay out the program.

#### Inheritance

This is where methods and attributes are use by derivative classes.

private - not accessible by child classes.

protected - accessible from child classes but not other classes.

public - accessible from other classes and child classes.

#### Polymorphism

This is where child classes can override the methods and attributes of parent classes to have the same methods that do different jobs.



#### Advantages

Forces better planning.

Allows encapsulation and independent testing.

Objects can be used by others without knowing how the internals work.

Objects can be re-used as libraries.

Easier to understand and maintain.
