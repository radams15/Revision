# Systems Analysis Methods

## Sections

#### Analysis

Requires:

- The data to use.
- The methods to make and use.
- How the program will be extended over time.

#### Design

This is the plan for:

- The structure of algorithms.
- The data structures used.
- The program inputs/outputs, including UI.
- The security of data through accidental or intentional damage.
- The hardware required to run the software.

#### Implementation

This is where the program is written, and runtime bugs
are fixed.

This is where the stakeholders will be asked about the program,
to find problems and solutions.

#### Testing

Black box - tests individual subroutines, tests them outside
	of the program.

White box - tests the program as a whole, testing inputs
			and outputs.

Alpha testing - tested by testers in the software company, to detect errors and requirements.

Beta testing - tested by users to detect hard-to-find problems
	that would not usually be found.

#### Evaluation

A post-evaluation review is where the developers check the system
after 3-6 months to find problems.


## Models

#### Waterfall

This uses the steps:

- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Maintenance

These steps are done in order.

Suitable for small projects, as there is no user in the
project.

#### Spiral

This uses the same steps as waterfall, but repeats the stages many
times until the program is complete.

This is good because they allow for changing user requirements.

#### Agile

This is a type of spiral, where the steps may not be done in order.

Some implementation could be done before the analysis is complete.

Iterative process.

Prototypes made at each stage.

This is a simple model.

There is rapid user feedback.

This allows requirements to change.

This allows incremental changes to the software.

#### Extreme programming

This is a type of agile programming, where release are made
very frequently.

To increase productivity.

#### Rapid application development

There are strict time limits for each part.

Software components are re-used to save time.

Many quick prototypes are made to refine the idea.

This is god as they save time, as the target is always changing.
