# Assembly Language

## Instruction Format

Instructions are stored as 16-bit words.

There is the opcode, which contains the instruction and the addressing mode, and there is the operand, which is the data to run the instruction on.

## Addressing modes

These are ways of addressing memory.

Intermediate addressing - the actual value to run the operation on.

Direct addressing - the memory address of the value.

Indirect addressing - the register address of the value address,

Indexed addressing - The address of the value is found by adding a value to the index register. This is used to find elements in successive memory locations, such as an array.
