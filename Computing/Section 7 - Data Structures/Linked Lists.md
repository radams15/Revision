#  Linked Lists

These are dynamic data structures that are comprised of nodes that contain a pointer
to other nodes.

The nodes are not stored in continuous memory locations.

Each node has 2 attributes:

- The data.
- The pointer to the next node, or `NULL` for the end of the list.

Their efficiency increases in time $O(n)$
