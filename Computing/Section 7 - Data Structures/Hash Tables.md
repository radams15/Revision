# Hash Tables

Indexes in databases must be generated by hashing a key.

Hashing algorithms are used to generate the index of the piece of data in a hash table.

If the hashing algorithm returns the same key for multiple data pieces, the data is placed in the next
free location. This is called a synonym, and will be found by doing a linear search past the correct location when
looking the data back up.

Hashing algorithms are chosen to generate the least number of synonyms, so the searching can be done very quickly.

Strings can be hashed by using their ASCII values.

Dictionaries are a type of hash table.

These have an efficiency of $O(1)$ if there are no duplicate hash values.

## Algorithms

#### Modulo

This is where `MOD` is used to create keys.

E.g `20 MOD 7` would be in position 6.

#### Folding

This is where the key is split into equal parts, then adds the parts to get the key.

E.g. 123456 would be split into 12, 34 and 56, which equals 102, so the data is stored at position 102.

#### Rehashing

This is used to find the next available slot if there has been a synonym.

A simple example is +3, where the value is incremented by 3 each time.
