# Queues

These are FIFO data structures.

Elements can only be added to the end of the queue.

A queue has a front and a rear, which change depending on if data is added or removed.

Dynamic queues are where the queue can grow or shrink depending on the amount of data stored.

Static queues are where the queue has a fixed size. This limitation can be fixed by using
a circular queue, where the rear can wrap around back to the start of the array.

Linear queues can be implemented as an array of items, or an array of pointers.

Priority queues are where items are ordered by priority, then by order in a queue.
