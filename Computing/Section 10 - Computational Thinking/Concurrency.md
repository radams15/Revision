# Concurrency

## Parallel Computing

This is where multiple processors each execute different instructions at the same
time.

Advantages:

- Several processes can be completed at the same time.
- Processors can work together to solve a task.

A disadvantage is that coordinating processors takes some resources.

## Concurrent Processing

This is where processor time is shared between processors.

Advantages:

- More tasks completed in the same time.
- No time wasted waiting for other programs to stop.

A disadvantage is that programs could use all of the processors and lock
up the system for other users.
