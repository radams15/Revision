# Nuclear Radius

$E_k = {
{Q_{\alpha (charge\ of\ \alpha\ particle)} Q_{N(charge\ of\ nucleus)}}
\over
{4\pi \epsilon_0 d_{(distance\ to\ nucleus\ edge)}}
}$

$\lambda_{db} = {hc \over \lambda} = {{hc}\over{mv^2}}$

Where $\lambda_{db}$ is the de-broglie wavlength.

If $v$ is the speed of light:

$v$ and $c^2$ cancel out.

$\lambda_{db} = {{h}\over{mv}} = {h \over \rho}$

## Nuclear Diffraction

$R_{(nuclear\ radius)}\sin(\theta_{min}) = 0.61\lambda_{db}$

$R = r_{0 (magnitude)} A^{1 \over 3}_{(atomic\ mass\ number)}$

$r_0$ is constant and is around $1.05 fm$

Can find $r_0$ by plotting a graph of $\ln(R)$ against $\ln(A)$. The y-intercept is $r_0$.
