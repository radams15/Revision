# Nuclear Reactors

Uses fissile $^{235} U$ at quantities of 2-3% to stop chain reactions.

Uses heat exchanger that uses irradiated coolant to heat water into steam that drives the turbine.

Fuel rods are inside the reactor core.

Core is reinforced with steel and concrete to stop radiation from leaving.

Control rods are vertical inside the core. They are continuously adjusted by a computer to keep reaction rate constant.

Moderators slow neutrons to the correct $E_k$ for fission to occur. They must elastically collide with neutrons to slow them.

Control rods are made from graphite and absorb neutrons to slow the reaction.

## Critical Mass

This is the minimum mass of fissile material needed to sustain the reaction, as:

- Some neutrons are absorbed by other atoms.

- Some neutrons escape the reactor.

## Waste

There are 3 levels of nuclear waste.

- High level - Spent fuel rods and objects that contact fissile materials.

- Intermediate - Low activity materials and containers.

- Low - Anything that has been near the reactor, like clothes or lab equipment.
