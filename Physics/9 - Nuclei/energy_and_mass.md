# Energy and Mass

Total mass of nucleus less than sum of its nucleons, because of binding energy.

This is where some of the mass is converted to energy to overcome the strong force.

$E = hf = mc^2$

Energy released by decay, $E = \Delta mc^2$

$1u = 931.5 MeV = 1.661 \times 10^{-27} kg$

$1u$ = mass of ${1 \over 12}^{th}$ the mass of one carbon-12 nucleus.

$\Delta m = Z_{p} + (A-Z)M_n - M_{Nuc}$

$Z_{p} = $ Mass of proton.

$Z_{n} = $ Mass of neutron.

$Z_{Nuc} = $ Mass of nucleus.

## Definitions

Mass defect - difference between mass of constituent parts and the nucleus mass.

Binding energy - work done to separate nucleus into constituent parts.

Binding energy per nucleon - average energy needed to remove a nucleon from the nucleus.

Binding energy per nucleon is also a measure of nuclear stability.
