# Fission and Fusion

## Fission

Splitting large nucleus afer absorbing a neutron. This splits into smaller nuclei, 2-3 neutrons and energy.

Neutrons always swapping about. Usually there are enough nucleons to stop the EM force tearing the nucleus apart.

Bombarding unstable nuclei with neutrons causes the EM force to tear the nucleus apart, leading to fission.
