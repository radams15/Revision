# Stress and Strain

$stress _{(Pa)} = {{F}\over{A}}$

$strain = {{\Delta L}\over{L}}$

Breaking stress is the point on a stress/strain graph where the material breaks.

Ultimate tensile strength is the maximum stress that can be experienced by the material.

### Energy Stored

$E = {{1}\over{2}} F \Delta L$

$F = K \Delta L$

$\therefore E = {{1}\over{2}} K \Delta L^2$

Energy stored is the area under a force/extension graph.

### Energy Changes

$\Delta E_k = \Delta E_{grav}$
