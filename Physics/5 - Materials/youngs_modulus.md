# Young Modulus

$E = {{Stress}\over{Strain}} = {{F/A}\over{\Delta L/L}} = {{FL}\over{A\Delta L}}$

Unit of $E$ is $Pa$.

### Experiment to Find $E$

Set up bench with pulley on one side and wood clamped on other.

Run length of wire between.

Find wire diameter with micrometer, calculate cross-sectional area.

Place ruler along wire, mark 0cm on the wire.

Increase the weight by 100g until the wire breaks.

Plot stress/strain graph.

The Young modulus, $E$, is the gradient of this graph.

$Energy = {{1}\over{2}} stress \times strain$ as long as Hooke's law is obeyed.
