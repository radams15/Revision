# Extension

$F = k \Delta L$

$K$ = spring constant = stiffness.

Extension is proportional to force.

Tensile = stretch.

Increasing extension past the elastic limit means the material will not return to its original length when force is removed.

Limit of proportionality is just before the elastic limit. This is where force $!\propto$ extension.

Elastic stretches return to their original length if the limit of proportionality is not passed.

Plastic stretches never return to their original length.
