# Resistivity

Resistivity is the resistance of a $1m$ length with a $1m^2$ cross-sectional-area.

$\rho = {{RA}\over{L}}$

### Determining Resistivity

Measure $V$ and $I$ for many lengths over a resistive wire, calculate $\Omega$ for each.

Calculate cross-sectional area by measuring resistive wire diameter with micrometer.

Plot $\Omega /L$ graph.

Gradient is $R \over L$.

Re-arrange $\rho = {{RA}\over{L}}$ to find ${{R}\over{L}} = {{\rho}\over{A}}$.

$\therefore gradient={{\rho}\over{A}}$

# Thermistors

As temperature increases, resistance decreases.

This is because when hotter, electrons have enough energy to escape the atoms, so there are more free electrons, so more charge can flow.

# Superconductors

Past **transitional temperature** there is no resistivity. Therefire no wasted current.
