# Energy Transfer

Energy transfers, either by:

- Work done on an object (force over distance)

- Heat flow via conduction, convection or radiation, where heat transfers from a warmer object to a cooler one.

# Internal Energy

This is the total energy of an object.

Based on:

- $E_k$ of particles.

- Potential energy of particles.

- Other energies such as magnetic forces.

## 1^st Law of Thermodynamics

"The change of internal energy of an object is equal to the total energy transfer due to work done and heating."

This means that if work is done on an object and the object does not heat up, then all the heat must be output.
