# Specific Heat Capacity

This is the energy required to raise the temperature of $1kg$ of a substance by 1 Â°C **without a change in state.**

$q_{(energy, J)} = m_{(mass, kg)}c_{(SHC, Jkg^{-1}K^{-1})} \Delta T_{(temperature\ change, K)}$

## Finding SHC

Get 1kg block of material.

Place heater in material.

Measure temperature change, current, voltage over a time period.

Use $E = IVt$ to calculate energy used.

Calculate SHC with equation.
