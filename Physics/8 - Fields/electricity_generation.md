# Electricity Generation

EM induction - emf is induced when a wire passes through a magnetic field. If this wire is part of a complete circuit, current flows in the wire.

Emf - electromagnetic force / electromagnetic flux.

Emf is not induced if the wire crosses parallel to the field lines.

Maximum emf is induces when the wire is perpendicular to the field lines.

Generator - wire moves in magnets.

Dynamo - magnet moves in wires.

## Fleming's Right Hand Rule

Thumb - Force/Motion.

Index finger - Magnetic Field.

Middle Finger - Electric current flow (^+ ve to ^- ve).

## Lenz's Law:

"Electric current induced in a conductor by a changing magnetic field is such that the magnetic field created by the induced current opposes changes in the initial magnetic field."

When a magnet is pushed into wire coil, current is created.

This current then creates a magnetic field, in the opposite direction. This opposes the original magnetic field.

## Magnetic Flux

$\Phi_{(magnetic\ flux, Wb)} = B_{(magnetic\ flux\ density, T)}A_{(area, m^2)}$

Emf is the rate of change of magnetic flux.

$\therefore \epsilon = Bl_{(length, m)}v_{(velocity, ms^-1)}$
