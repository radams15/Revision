# Phenol

Weak acid.

Phenoxide ion is very strong base.

## Bromylation

$Phenol + 3BR_2 \rightarrow 2,4,6-tribromophenol + 3HBr$

2,4,6-tribromophenol:

This is test for phenol.

Phenol + bromine water forms white precipitate.

## Nitration

Adding dilute $HNO_3$ to phenol forms both 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol.

## Activating and Deactivating Groups

Phenol does not require a catalyst for reactions.

This is because the lone pair of oxygen joins the delocalised $\pi$ system of the benzene, increasing the electronegativity and therefore reactivity of phenol.

Benzene is also activated by the amine group in phenylamine.

These are activating groups.

Activating groups direct to positions 2, 4 & 6.

Deactivating groups direct to positions 3 & 5.

An example of a deactivating group is $NO_2$.
