# Qualitative Analysis

These are tests for ions.

## Carbon dioxide

Bubble gas through limewater.

If the limewater turns cloudy, the gas is $CO_2$.

## Carbonates

Add dilute $HNO_3$.

$CO_2$ released, test with limewater as above.

## Ammonium

Warm the liquid to release the gas.

Place litmus paper in the gas.

If the paper turns blue the gas is ammonium.

## Sulphate

Add $BaCl_2$.

If a white precipitate is formed, there are sulphate ions.


# Order of tests

The order must be:

- Carbonates
- Sulphates
- Halides

This is because the barium carbonate in water looks like a white
precipitate, so must first be tested with a carbonate test which
removes any carbonates. The first step of a sulphate test is also
to remove any carbonates by adding some nitric acid, so a carbonate test
is effectively the same as the first step of a sulphate test.

We use $HNO_3$ as $H_2 SO_4$ has sulphate ions which would contaminate further tests.
