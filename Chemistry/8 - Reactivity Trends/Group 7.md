# Group 8

These are also known as the halogens, and are very reactive as they only need to gain one
electron to fill all their shells.

| Element | State  | Colour           |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| $F_2$   | Gas    | Pale yellow      |
| $Cl_2$  | Gas    | Pale green       |
| $Br_2$  | Liquid | Red-brown        |
| $I_2$   | Solid  | Shiny grey-black |
| $At_2$  | Solid  | Never seen       |

At RTP all the halogens are diatomic.

## Boiling points

Down the group:

- More electrons
- Stronger London forces
- More energy is required to overcome the London forces.
- Boiling point increases


## Reactivity

Down the group:

- Atomic radius increases
- More electron shielding
- Less nuclear attraction at the outer shell
- Reactivity decreases

## Halide Displacement

| Halogen | $Cl_2$                   | $Br_2$                  | $I_2$       |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| $Cl^-$  |                          | No Reaction             | No Reaction |
| $Br^-$  | Orange as $Br_2$ formed. |                         | No Reaction |
| $I^-$   | Violet as $I_2$ formed.  | Violet as $I_2$ formed. |             |

Halides are very good oxidising agents as they are very electronegative. This means they acn attract electrons
very well in order to fill their last electron in the $p$ orbital.

# Identification

Halides can be reacted with $AgNO_3$ to form different coloured precipitates.

- $Cl \Rightarrow$ White precipitate
- $Br \Rightarrow$ Cream precipitate
- $I \Rightarrow$ Yellow precipitate

| Ion    | With $AgNO_3$      | With dilute $NH_3$  | With concentrated $NH_3$ |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| $F^-$  | No Change          |                     |                          |
| $Cl^-$ | White precipitate  | Colourless solution |                          |
| $Br^-$ | Cream precipitate  | Cream precipitate   | Colourless solution      |
| $I^-$  | Yellow precipitate | Yellow precipitate  | Yellow precipitate       |

Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between a white, cream or yellow precipitate.

Dilute and concentrated ammonia is used to re-dissolve precipitates at different concentrations,
and the table above shows what to expect when using ammonia.

# Uses

## Water treatment:

$Cl$ is used to kill bacteria in water.
