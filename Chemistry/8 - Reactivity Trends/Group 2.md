# Group 2 Elements

These are sometimes called the alkaline metals as they form metal hydroxides that
are alkaline.

They do not occur naturally as they are so reactive - they are usually found as stable compounds
such as $CaCO_3$.

Group 2 elements are good reducing agents as they have only 2 electrons, meaning the
metals are good at losing electrons to other elements, therefore reducing them.

They are called reducing agents as they cause other elements to be reduced.

The metals get more reactive going down the group, e.g. $Be$ is less reactive than $Ra$.

These metals often participate in redox reactions.

## Redox Reactions

### Oxygen:

$2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO$, where:

- Each $Mg$ is oxidised from 0 to +2
- Each O is reduced from 0 to -2.

### Water:

$Sr + 2H_2 O \rightarrow Sr(OH)_2 + H_2$, where:

- $Sr$ is oxidised from 0 to +2.
- Some $H_2$ is reduced from +1 to 0.

### Acids:

$Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2$, where:

- 1 $Mg$ is oxidised from 0 to +2.
- Each $H$ is reduced from +1 to 0.


## Oxide reactions

### Water:

$CaO + H_2 O \rightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2OH^-$

Since these elements are only slightly soluble, past a saturated solution a solid
precipitate forms:

$Ca^{2+} + 2OH^- \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2$

## Solubility and pH

$Ba(OH)_2$ is more soluble than $Mg(OH)_2$

The $Ba(OH)_2$ has a pH of 13, the $Mg(OH)_2$ has a pH of 10.


## Uses

Group 2 compounds are often used for treading indigestion to neutralise stomach
acid as they are alkaline.
