# Complex Ions

## Definitions

Coordinate Bond - A covalent bond in which both electrons in the
shared pair come from the same atom. Also called a dative bond.

Ligand - An ion or molecule that forms a coordinate bond with a
transition metal.

Coordination number - The number of coordinate bonds to ligands that
surround the transition metal ion.

Complex ion - A metal ion surrounded by coordinately bonded ligands.

Monodentate - A ligand that can only form one coordinate bond.

Bidentate - A ligand that can form two coordinate bonds.

Polydentate - Ligands that can form more than one coordinate bond.


## Complexes

Complexes are formed when transition metals or ions form dative
bonds with ligands.

Cations => $^+Ve$

Anions => $^-Ve$

An example of a complex ion is $[Cu(H_2 O)_6]^{2+}$.

### Monodentate

Forms one coordinate bond. Examples are:

- $H_2 O$
- $Cl^-$
- $NH_3$
- $CN^-$

Ammonia has 1 lone pair to donate.

Water has 2 lone pairs but they are so close only 1 coordinate
bond can form.

### Bidentate

These form 2 coordinate bonds from 2 donors.

Examples:

- Ethane - 1, 2-diamine


### Polydentate

These form 3 **or more** coordinate bonds by donating at least 3 lone
pairs to the metal ion.

Extremely stable as the reaction results in an increase in entropy.

An example is EDTA.


### EDTA

This has 6 lone pairs to form 6 coordinate bonds with metal ions.






# Stereoisomerism

Cis/trans isomerism occurs in some square planar and octahedral complex ions.

An example of cis/trans isomerism is in the complex $[Pd(NH_3 )_2 Cl_2]$, which is
square planar.

In the cis isomer of this, the coordinate bonds between identical ligands are $90^\circ$ apart,
but in the trans isomer, the ligands are $180^\circ$ apart.
