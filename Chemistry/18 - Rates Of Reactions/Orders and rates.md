# Orders and Rates

$Rate = {{\text{Quantity reacted or produces}}\over{Time}}$

This can be shortened to:

$Rate = {{\text{Change in concentration} (moldm^{-3})}\over{Time (s)}}$

Concentration can be represented by surrounding the variable with
square brackets, e.g. Concentration of $NaCl$ is $[NaCl]$.
