# Rate of Reaction

$Rate (moldm^{-3}s^{-1}) = {{\text{Change in concentration} (moldm^{-3})}\over{\text{time}(seconds)}}$

To measure rate we can measure:

- Gas production
- Mass change
- Colour change
- Precipitate formation

Factors affecting rate:

- Temperature
- Concentration
- Pressure
- Surface area
- Catalysts
