# Catalysts

These are often transition elements.

They are usually used as tiny beads or cylinders, meaning their surface area is increased.

Catalysts react to either form an intermediate molecule, or to act as a surface for the reaction
to occur in.

Catalysts are never used up in a reaction, and only increase speed, not quantity of product.

Catalysts provide a lower energy pathway, meaning that more particles have enough energy to react,
meaning there are more **successful** collisions so a faster rate.

## Types of Catalyst

### Homogeneous

These are when the catalyst and the reactants are in the same state.

An intermediate molecule is made.

An example is making esters from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, where
a $H_2 SO_4$ catalyst is used.

### Heterogeneous

This is where the catalyst is a different state to the products. The reactants are
absorbed into the catalyst, and the products are desorbed from the catalyst.

An example is the Haber process:

$H_2 + I_2 \rightarrow 2HI$
