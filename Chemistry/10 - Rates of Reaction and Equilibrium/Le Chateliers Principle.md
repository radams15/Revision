# Le Chatelier's Priniple

This is where equilibrium changes to favour either the forwards or backwards reactions, opposing changes made to a closed system.

Factors affecting equilibrium are:

* Pressure
* Concentration
* Temperature

Rate - The speed a product is formed.

Yield - How much product is formed compared to reactants.

## Pressure

Higher pressured cause reactions to shift to the side with the fewest moles.

Lower pressure means more molecules are made.

## Temperature

Higher temperature causes a shift to the endothermic side of the reaction.

## Concentration

Increasing concentration of one side causes equilibrium to move to the opposite side.

## Industry

In industry high yields at the lowest cost are essential, so using every way to increase rate is essential, but only until is is cost effective.

In the Haber process, high temperatures are used even though the exothermic side is wanted, as a low temperature causes a low rate of reaction, which is also bad for producing product.
