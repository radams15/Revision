# Isomerism

Exists structural isomerism, stereoisomerism.

Stereoisomerism includes optical isomerism and E/Z isomerism.

Structural includes chain isomerism, positional isomerism, functional group isomerism.

## Structural Isomerism

Same molecular formula, different structural formula.

### Chain Isomerism

Same molecular formula, with carbon chain branches.

### Positional Isomerism

Same molecular formula, different positions of a group.

### Functional Group Isomerism

Same molecular formula, different functional group.

E.g. alcohol and ether.


## Stereoisomerism

Same structural formula, different arrangement in space.

### E/Z Isomerism

Restricted rotation around a $C$=$C$ bond.

E = opposite sides.

Z = same side.

### Optical Isomerism

Occurs at chiral carbons.

Chiral carbon - carbon with 4 **different** chains leaving it.

One rotates polarised light left, the other right.

Double-bonds are never chiral as $C$ bonded to the same chain twice.
